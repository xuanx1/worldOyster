### 🎮 Interactive Timeline Controls
- **Video-like scrubber**: Drag the glowing timeline head to jump to any point in your journey
- **Play/Pause controls**: Start, stop, and resume animation with smooth transitions
- **Auto-loop**: Animation automatically restarts when reaching the end
- **Progress tracking**: Visual progress bar shows journey completion percentage

### 🌍 Dynamic Map Visualization
- **Animated flight paths**: Watch your journey unfold in real-time with moving dots
- **Flight line toggle**: Show/hide flight connections with airplane emoji button
- **Interactive markers**: Cities appear as you visit them with hover information
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### 📊 Environmental Impact Tracking
- **Real-time emissions**: CO₂ calculations update as you scrub through the timeline
- **Mode-specific factors**: Different emission rates for flights, trains, cars, and ferries
  - ✈️ Flights: 0.25 kg CO₂/km
  - 🚂 Trains: 0.04 kg CO₂/km  
  - 🚗 Cars: 0.12 kg CO₂/km
  - ⛴️ Ferries: 0.12 kg CO₂/km
- **Live statistics**: Distance traveled and carbon footprint update during scrubbing

### 🎯 Advanced Features
- **Seamless scrubbing**: Timeline updates all map elements, statistics, and animations
- **Smart line management**: Flight lines appear/disappear based on timeline position
- **Country recognition**: Comprehensive mapping of cities and airport codes to countries
- **Data validation**: Prevents spurious connections between unrelated locations

### Data Format
Place your travel data in CSV format:
- `flightdiary_2025_09_15_05_15.csv` - Flight data
- `land-journey.csv` - Ground transportation data

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js v1.9.4
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with glow effects and transitions
- **Animation**: JavaScript requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animation
- **Data Processing**: Custom CSV parser with chronological sorting
- **Country Mapping**: Comprehensive city and airport code databases
